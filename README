This program is the implementation of a min-heap with C++. It has many functions 
that are common to heaps. In this program, the functions included are initialize,
buildheap, insert,delete minimum, decrease key, and print heap.Files part of this
project are main.cpp, main.h, heap.cpp, heap.h, util.cpp, and util.h.

Progam Commands:
S, the program stops.

C n, the program creates an empty heap with capacity equal to n, and waits for the
next command.

On reading R, the program reads in the array A from file HEAPinput.txt, calls the linear time build
heap algorithm to build the heap based on A, and waits for the next command.

On reading W, the program writes the current heap information to the screen, and waits for the
next command.

On reading I k, the program inserts an element with key equal to k into the current heap, and waits
for the next command.

On reading D, the program deletes the minimum element from the heap and prints the key field of
the deleted element on the screen, it waits for the next command.

On reading K i v, the program decreases the key of element with index i to the new value v, provided
that the new value is not larger than the previous value.
